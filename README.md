In this project, I will analyze how digital and social contacts within the family and workplace are related to subjective well-being, happiness, and social exclusion in Switzerland. Switzerland was chosen due to its high GDP per capita, which is directly connected to work organization, happiness, and quality of life. The goal is to explore how digital and real-life social connections impact the well-being of individuals in a wealthy society.
